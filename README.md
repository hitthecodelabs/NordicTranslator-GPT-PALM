# NordicTranslator-GPT-PALM

## Project Overview
This project focuses on translating article titles and descriptions from English to Norwegian using advanced language models. We leverage two leading models: GPT (versions 3.5 and 4) and PALM (Text-Bison models), to achieve high-quality translations.

## Methodology
- **Input**: English text (titles and descriptions).
- **Processing**: Utilizing GPT-3.5/GPT-4 and Text-Bison models through their respective APIs.
- **Output**: Translated content in Norwegian, formatted in JSON.

## Features
- **Bilingual Translation**: Converts English text into Norwegian while preserving the original context and nuances.
- **Dual Model Approach**: Uses the strengths of both GPT and PALM models for translation.
- **JSON Output**: Easy integration and usage in various applications due to JSON format.
